This note reflects on my learning journey throughout the course **"Modelling humanities data with TEI-XML,"** tracing my evolution from basic DTD customization to the creative "consecration" of ODD modeling.

In **Assignment 1**, I approached DTD customization by leaning heavily on existing TEI structures. While TEI seemed like the “easy way” out, this reliance became a significant hurdle; I struggled to step outside the predefined framework to create a DTD that truly addressed the unique requirements of my performance-based materials. I was following the rules but not yet building them.

**Assignment 2**, working with full TEI-XML, was a revelation. I realized that the standard framework could be a “false friend.” While it offers a vast vocabulary, its generic nature lacked the necessary flexibility to accurately model a diverse corpus consisting of professional shooting scripts and amateur reconstructions. I found that strictly adhering to the standard often obscured the multimodal nuances, such as specific technical cues and directorial intent, that I wanted to preserve.

**Assignment 3** allowed me to translate specific corpus features into clear encoding decisions. This final task helped me turn my research into a concrete, tailored project. I learned how to carefully identify what my work actually especially needed. I also understood the technical limits and found ways to overcome them or use them to my advantage. Instead of being stuck, I learned to control the process so the tools finally served my own intent.

Ultimately, while the learning curve for XML is steep and often frustrating, overcoming these obstacles has been deeply rewarding. The process has shifted from a technical struggle to a creative “gam...

                  med school being taught by doctors. Today, you are the doctors. The seven years
                  you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life. You
                  will be pushed to the breaking point. Look around you. Say hello to your
                  competition. Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty. Five of you will
                  crack under the pressure. Two of you will be asked to leave. This is your starting
                  line. This is your arena. How well you play? That's up to you.</p>

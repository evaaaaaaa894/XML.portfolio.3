# Script Encoding Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the TEI-XML encoding course. It focuses on the digital modeling of three television script excerpts from various production contexts. The aim is to present an XML/TEI-based model adaptable to different script formats—from professional shooting scripts to amateur reconstructions.

## Repository Structure
The project is organized into the following directory structure

- **`mgodd.odd`**: The master TEI ODD customization file.
- **`out/`**: Generated files for validation and documentation:
  - `mgodd.rng`: The RelaxNG schema.
  - `mgodd.html`: The human-readable project guidelines.
- **`encoding/`**: Encoded TEI-XML extracts validated against the custom schema (`fbTS.xml`, `gaTS.xml`, `dwTS.xml`).
- **`authorities/`**: HTML files containing external taxonomies and indices for character identification.
- **`sources/`**: Raw materials:
  - `raw/`: Original script formats (PDF/Image).
  - `text/`: Plain text versions of the excerpts.
- **`Reflexive.md`**: A reflection note on the learning and encoding process.

## AI Statement
AI was used only as a conversational and brainstorming tool for structuring ideas and refining the Markdown layout. All conceptual, editorial, and encoding work was carried out independently, as I do not believe in AI technical capacities.

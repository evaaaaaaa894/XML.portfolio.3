# Script Encoding Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the TEI-XML encoding course. It focuses on the digital modeling of three television script excerpts from various production contexts. This project aims to present an XML/TEI-based model adaptable to different script formats—from professional shooting scripts to amateur reconstructions.


## Repository Structure
[cite_start]The project is organized into the following directory structure [cite: 506-511]:

* [cite_start]**`mgodd.odd`**: The master TEI ODD customization file[cite: 508].
* [cite_start]**`out/`**: Generated files for validation and documentation[cite: 509]:
    * `mgodd.rng`: The RelaxNG schema.
    * `mgodd.html`: The human-readable project guidelines.
* [cite_start]**`TEI_XML_Files/`**: Encoded TEI-XML extracts validated against the custom schema (`fbTS.xml`, `gaTS.xml`, `dwTS.xml`)[cite: 510].
* *`External_Lists/`**: HTML files containing external taxonomies and indices used for character identification.
* **`sources/`**: Raw materials:
    * `raw/`: Original script formats (PDF/Image).
    * `text/`: Plain text versions of the excerpts.
* [cite_start]**`Reflexive_Note.pdf`**: A reflection note on the learning and encoding process.

## AI Statement
AI was used only as a conversational and brainstorming tool for structuring ideas and refining the Markdown layout. All conceptual, editorial, and encoding work was carried out independently as I do not believe in AI technical capacities.
